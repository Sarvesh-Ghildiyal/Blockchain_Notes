>So now you do realise what new changes will blockchain bring to your traditional monetrary methods. So, lets discuss some features of blockchain now, eh?

## Decentralization
The most significant property of blockchain, decentralization: what it basically means is there should be no central authority over the network, then who controlls and manages the network ?? huh???

Well to solve this problem all the computers (node) in the blockchain network are given the completely authority of the network and if something new is brought or thought of in the network, wheather these changes will be aapplied to the network or not are decided by like democratic elections are held! but here the approving party are nodes in the blockchain network.

Further there are **consensus** to be followed, to protect your blochain network from any absurd and inappropriate activity over the network.


*The concept of **decentralized** network is slightly different from **distributed** network as in distributed network tasks are distributed to achieve a common goal but in decentralized network, distribution is used to eliminate single point failure of your network and concept of commnon goals is slightly modified.*




## Immutablity
Once a change has been made in your blockchain network it cannot be changed thus providing very secure system and network which makes it kinda immposible to hack and alter data in a blockchain network in any malicious network.

Que-Now, you are probably wondering isnt the immutablity kind of a bad feature or a demerit for the netwrok?

Ans- Well no, we needed a network whose data cannot be changed once implemented we wanted *diterministic*  property in our network. You see, there is blockchain network is widely used for monetrary purpose, so in the ledger (stroing those transaction of your) you would not want that any previous data shall be tampered or changed, well welcome to blockchain buddy!



## Transparency

                 TRUTH > TRUST
Now if each netwok is in controll of the whole network how would u prevent a hacker who may hack one node of the network and may tamper your data in network as he suits?


Well this is prevented by *transparent feature* of the blockchain network as whenever, a transaction is made that transaction is shared to all the nodes present in the network so, even if any data is tempered by a hacker from one or two network it wont actually affect the network as remaining 98 of nodes (majority) will be suggesting/showing some other results.


So, this transparency nature of blockchain removes the concept of **"TRUST"** but brings **"TRUTH"** in the network and if you are smart enough you would choose truth over trust.



Que- If all of our transactions are visible to all the nodes in the network. So, do we not have any privacy in the network at all?

Ans- Well you stil own your privacy as in the network noone knows your real identity unless you tell others this **Public Key** belongs to me. So, yea like a bank account no third person will know of the transaction unless you show him your daybook and show your transaction along with bank account's holder personal detail along with the bank id.




## Double Spending
Now how does blockchain network deals with double spending problem (making unlimited money by sending one bill over and over again) of yours?
Well transparency feature discussed above solves that for you, *single history of transactions that are sent on the network.* helps us solving this problem.
